Here are the basic requirements for either project:

Use Devise to create user authentication first. Consider creating different privileges for a user and an admin - either by creating a boolean admin property on a user or by creating separate user and admin Devise models.
Use ActiveStorage to add images.
Use FactoryBot to supplement your integration tests and your model testing.
Deploy to Heroku. (All functionality should be in place and all tests passing!)
